title: SIP-14 - Redesign of scala.concurrent

Redesign of `scala.concurrent` into a unified substrate for different parallel frameworks

# Tasks, Futures, and Promises

## Architecture

`Task`s, `Future`s, and `Promise`s are separate. In concrete implementations, they may be the same classes, 
but this is not shown in the public API, and their exact types are hidden by the `makeTask` and `makePromise` 
factory methods.

The reasoning behind this is as follows; `Task`s are used internally by different frameworks, and therefore 
they have no need for monadic operations like those found in `Future`s. It must also be possible to separate 
`Task`-creation from scheduling. 

Since, the "owner" of a `Promise` has produced the value to be placed within a `Future`, thus it should not be 
necessary to call the `Future` monadic operations to access that same value. This also avoids programmer 
errors, such as calling `get` on a `Promise`, which may cause a deadlock. 

## Cancellation
## Exceptions
## Draft Proposal of the Future Trait
    trait Future[+T] {
      /** Blocks the current thread until the Future has been completed or the
       *  timeout has expired. If a timeout happens, an exception will be stored in the Future object.
       */
      def await(implicit context: ExecutionContext, timeout: Duration = ExecutionContext.timeout): Future[T]
      
      def get(implicit context: ExecutionContext, timeout: Duration = ExecutionContext.timeout): Option[T]
      
      def apply(implicit context: ExecutionContext, timeout: Duration = ExecutionContext.timeout): T
      
      def cps: ContinuationFuture[T] // We should perhaps think of a better name for this one
      
      // transformation methods
      def orElse[U >: T](other: Future[U]): Future[U]
      
      def map[U](fun: T => U): Future[U]
      
      def flatMap[U](fun: T => Future[U]): Future[U] 
      
      def flatten[U](implicit f: <:< [T, Future[U]]): Future[U]
      
      def filter(pred: T => Boolean): Future[T]
      
      def collect[U](pf: PartialFunction[T, U]): Future[U]
      
      def andThen[U](fun: T => U)(implicit evidence: MapEvidence): Future[U]
      
      def andThen[U](fun: T => Future[U])(implicit evidence: FlatMapEvidence): Future[U]
      
      def recover[U >: T](pf: PartialFunction[Throwable, U]): Future[U]
      
      /**
       * Await completion of this Future and return its value if it conforms to U's
       * erased type. Will place a ClassCastException into the Future object if the value 
       * does not conform, or a TimeoutException if it times out.
       */
      def as[U: Manifest]: Future[U] 
      
      // accessors
      def foreach[U](fun: T => U): Unit
      
      // callback methods: TBD
    }
## Draft Proposal of the Task Trait

    trait Task[+T] {
      
      def future: Future[T]
      
      def start(): Unit
      
    }


# Migration
## Migration From Existing Futures
## Updating Other Components of scala.concurrent to Use ExecutionContexts

# Utilities
## Scheduler
For scheduling the start of `Task`s.
## TimeOut and Duration

# Evaluation
**Goal:** Re-implement examples from the .NET Task-based Async Pattern paper \[[1][1]\], and from Finagle's documentation \[[2][2]\].
